# Task 12: Image Gallery with Modal Popup

## Project Description
In this task, I built an interactive image gallery. The key feature is a "Modal Popup" that allows users to view high-resolution versions of images in an overlay without navigating away from the main page.

## Key Features Implemented
* **Grid Gallery**: Created a responsive image grid using CSS Grid.
* **Modal Logic**: Developed a popup system that triggers on image clicks and updates content dynamically.
* **UX Enhancements**: Added a background overlay to focus attention and disabled body scrolling while the modal is open.
* **Accessibility**: Implemented "ESC" key support to allow keyboard users to close the modal easily.
* **Z-Index Management**: Used `z-index` to ensure the modal always appears on top of all other page elements.
